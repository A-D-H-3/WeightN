        Peter Griffin: Oh, okay, here's another riddle. A woman has two
        children. Now, a homicidal maniac tells her she can only keep one. Which
        one does she let 'im kill? Brian Griffin: That's, that's not a riddle.
        That's, that's just terrible. Peter Griffin: Wrong! It's the ugly one.
        Peter Griffin: Look, you got anything you could possibly want right
        here, now just eat your cinnamon bun, and stop being a bad dog. Brian
        Griffin: [gasp] How dare you? How dare you! Peter Griffin: How dare I?
        How dare I? Were do you think you're going? Brian Griffin: [angrily]
        Out. Peter Griffin: Hey, you're not going anywhere without your leash.
        Brian Griffin: I don't need your damn leash, and I don't need you! I'm
        going for a walk. [shuts door] Peter Griffin: Don't worry. He won't get
        far without this. [shows something strange] Lois Griffin: Why don't you
        take Joe caroling? Peter Griffin: Yeah, that'd be as fun as a lecture on
        ontological empiricism. Lois Griffin: What? Peter Griffin: What?
        Cleveland: Public urination is just wrong. Except during the Million Man
        March when protestors burned down our porta-potties and I used my stream
        of justice to put out the hate. Meg Griffin: Wow, Chris, did you lose
        weight? Chris Griffin: Well, I've been working out all week. Meg
        Griffin: You look wicked skinny. I'm like, jealous. Chris Griffin:
        Thanks, Meg. I'm jealous of your mustache. Meg Griffin: [freaked] I
        don't have a mustache... do I?
